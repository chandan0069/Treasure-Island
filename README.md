# Treasure-Island


Treasure Island Game

This Python code implements a simple text-based adventure game where you explore a mythical island and search for treasure.

Gameplay:

The game begins with a welcome message and your mission to find the treasure. You'll encounter various choices that will determine your success. Read the prompts carefully and make your selections by typing 'left' or 'right' at the crossroads, 'wait' or 'swim' at the lake, and a color (red, yellow, or blue) for the island house doors.

Possible Outcomes:

Winning: If you make the right choices (wait for the boat, choose the yellow door), you'll find the treasure and win the game!
Losing: Making wrong choices (falling into a hole, being attacked by a trout, entering the red or blue door) will result in a game over scenario
